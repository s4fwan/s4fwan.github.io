            <h1>Safwan Abrar</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a final-year Software Engineering student with a passion for building reliable, impactful, and user-focused digital solutions.
                What began as a fascination with technology has evolved into a career journey that blends software development with system reliability
                and infrastructure engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I’m a Site Reliability Engineering Intern at Cisco Meraki, where I work on improving internal infrastructure through automation,
                provisioning workflows, and scalable system design. My role has deepened my knowledge of tools like Docker, Ansible, and Airflow, while also
                sharpening my skills in troubleshooting, documentation, and cross-functional collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my degree and co-op experience, I've developed a strong foundation in clean code practices, cloud-based systems, and team-based
                problem solving. I enjoy learning new technologies, improving processes, and contributing to solutions that balance innovation with stability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and build systems that work better—for people and for the planet.
            </p>
